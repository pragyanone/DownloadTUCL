# DownloadTUCL

- The [Tribhuvan University Central Library (eLibrary)](https://elibrary.tucl.edu.np/) website is frequently inaccessible during the day.
- This Python script downloads all thesis papers within a specified collection *(Department)* (e.g., Department of Civil Engineering).
- Files downloaded for the Department of Civil Engineering as of 2024-06-04 can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B_prOMKvjyQcjkBLBhmMjrqoN1HDtgJp?usp=drive_link).

## Usage
1. Update the `base_url` to reflect your chosen collection.
2. Adjust the page range as needed (`range(1, 8)`).
3. Run the script.
4. Open page1.html and browse.

## Limitation
1. The website currently only allows filtering at the collection level *(as far as I know)*. It would be more helpful if filtering by specific programs (e.g., MSc. in Transportation Engineering) was possible.

Feedback is welcome.
